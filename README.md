# PSIE: The Planetary Science Inference Engine

Code base for Likelihood-Free Inference modeling system designed for planetary science workflows. Enables rigorous Bayesian model selection and parameter estimation even where formal evidence integrals are otherwise intractable: if you can simulate it, you can do inference on it.

Under development by the [Project ESPRESSO SSERVI Node](https://www.espresso.institute).
